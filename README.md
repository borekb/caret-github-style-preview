# Alternative GitHub-style preview for Caret

[Caret](https://caret.io/), the amazing Markdown editor, ships with a GitHub-style preview CSS that uses Arial and styles from circa 2016. This is an alternative stylesheet with GitHub-style preview as of March 2017.

## How to use

1. In Caret, invoke menu > View > Add Theme...
2. Copy `New GitHub.css` there
3. Restart Caret
4. Select the preview theme, enjoy!

## Dev notes

The style is adapted from from [sindresorhus/github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css), version [`322382b`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css/blob/322382b0504213e608cba0449c95b3fe98ca8ec9/github-markdown.css) which is also copied to `github-markdown.css` in this repo. You can compare `github-markdown.css` to `New GitHub.css` to see what changes have been done.
